## Short report example: Initial descriptive stats for an educational assessment dataset

For this example we are going to use a dataset that comes with the `conquestr` package available on github. It can be installed as follows:

```{r install_conquestr, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("markdly/conquestr")
```

After installing we can access the inbuilt data (alternatively you could read in a csv file here etc)
```{r datasets}
library(DT)
library(conquestr)
resp <- conquestr::short_test
```

Student responses to item are stored in `resp`. Here are the first 8 records:

```{r resp_table, echo=FALSE}
#knitr::kable(head(resp))
DT::datatable(
  head(resp, 8),
  fillContainer = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5)
)
```

There are a total of `r nrow(resp)` cases.
